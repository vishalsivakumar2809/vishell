```vishell``` is my custom-built shell implemented in C, offering Unix-like functionality and process control. It supports command execution, I/O redirection, simple piping, and background process handling.

# Key Features:
Built-in commands: ```cd```, ```pwd```, ```exit```
Support for external commands like ```ls```, ```echo```, etc.
Input (<) and output (>) redirection
Basic piping (cmd1 | cmd2)
Background process execution with &
Signal handling for Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP) â€” prevents the shell itself from terminating or suspending

# How it Works:
The program begins with ```initialize()```, which sets up signal handlers via ```signal_callback_handler()``` to gracefully handle user interruptions.

It enters an infinite loop to:
1. Read and tokenize user input
2. Handle built-in commands (```cd```, ```pwd```, ```exit```)
3. Manage redirection (<, >) and piping (|)
4. Spawn child processes using ```fork()``` and execute commands with ```execvp()``` or ```execve()```
5. Track background and suspended processes
